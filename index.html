                            <h5>Project Context and Justification</h5>
                            <p>During my internship at Truck Support Venlo, I was tasked with addressing a significant challenge that impacts the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their operations—tire procurement for trucks. Unlike the car tire sector, which benefits from a variety of advanced analytical tools, the truck tire sector suffers from a noticeable gap in similar technologies. This disparity has left warehouse managers at Truck Support without the necessary tools to make informed purchasing decisions, relying on fragmented and often outdated data to compare tire prices and quality.</p>
                            <h5>Project Goal</h5>
                            <p>The primary goal of this project was to develop a straightforward yet powerful software tool designed to streamline the tire buying process for warehouse managers. By providing a comprehensive comparison of tire suppliers along with actionable buying advice, the software aims to ensure that warehouse managers can procure high-quality tires at the best possible prices. This, in turn, enhances operational efficiency and drives cost savings across the organization.</p>
                            <h5>Project Scope</h5>
                            <p>The project scope was clearly defined to focus exclusively on the procurement of truck tires. Key features included:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Market Research: Conducting extensive market research to gather accurate and current data on tire prices and supplier reliability.</li>
                                <li>Scalable Application: Developing a scalable application that could adapt to growing data and user needs without degradation in performance.</li>
                                <li>Development of Scraping Bots: Creating sophisticated web scraping bots that automate the collection of tire data from various online sources, ensuring the data is current and comprehensive.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Conversely, the project was scoped with specific exclusions to maintain focus and manage resources effectively:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The application would not support the procurement of other types of goods or services.</li>
                                <li>It would not facilitate direct negotiations or transactions between warehouse managers and suppliers.</li>
                                <li>The focus would remain on suppliers within a specific region or country, excluding global market data unless relevant and feasible.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Constraints and Conditions</h5>
                            <p>The development of the project was underpinned by several conditions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A research paper would be prepared to document the findings and methodologies used.</li>
                                <li>An application architecture that includes both frontend and backend components would be developed, along with a working demo.</li>
                                <li>Technical assistance would be available as needed to address any complex challenges that might arise during development.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Document References</h5>

                                        <li>Continuous Refinement: Starting with intensive requirement gathering, where potential users were engaged and market research conducted, the product backlog was regularly updated to reflect emerging insights and needs.</li>
                                        <li>Iterative Design and Development: System design was approached iteratively, allowing for adjustments based on user feedback and evolving project scopes. Development proceeded in cycles, integrating new features and improvements progressively.</li>

                                    <p class="text-start">The first step in my project was to understand and organize tire data from different suppliers. This was challenging due to the different ways suppliers record information. I focused on making this data uniform, or normalized, so that it could be used effectively.</p>

                                    <p class="text-start">I collected tire specifications from suppliers like Kosson, which included details like width, aspect ratio, rim diameter, and more. Using Python scripts and Flask services, I automated the cleaning and standardization of this data to ensure consistency.</p>

                                    <p class="text-start">Normalization involved adjusting the data to a standard format. For example, I converted all measurements to millimeters and ensured that all categories like manufacturer names were uniform across the dataset.</p>
                                    
                                    <!-- Portfolio Modal - Data Matching-->
                                    <h5 class="text-start mt-4">Matching Process</h5>
                                    <p class="text-start">After normalization, I matched the tire data from Kosson with our main database (Bac dataset) to find exact or closely similar entries. This step was crucial for integrating new data with existing records, using attribute comparison techniques for accuracy.</p>

                                    <p class="text-start">My efforts resulted in a 66% match rate, which significantly improved the usability of the tire data for operational purposes. This has enabled better decision-making in tire purchases and inventory management for truck companies.</p>

                                    <p class="text-start">Some challenges included missing manufacturer codes and discrepancies in tire model names. These issues led to unmatched entries, which I plan to address by updating our datasets and improving our data cleaning processes.</p>
